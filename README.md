# ticketShare
I started this project while doing my appreticeship in 2022. The goal was to apply what I was learning at vocational school and at the company where I was working.

My idea was to create an application where passengers could offer the remaining seats of a group train ticket to other passengers during a ride. Users should also be able to search for existing ride offers.
